manageOpenKey.exe is used to register the (Excel Addin) .xll for all users. It sets the HKCU OPEN key to make sure that the addin will load automatically in Excel. In addition, it is also been used by ActiveSetup so that new window users, during first login, will also have the HKCU OPEN key.
IMPORTANT: for uninstall this .exe is also used by ActiveSetup to remove the HKCU OPEN key for all users. Therefore the manageOpenKey.exe is not removed directly after uninstall. If you are sure that all users that had the addin do not have any longer the HKCU OPEN key (by login at least once after uninstall) then, you may remove manageOpenKey.exe and this README file.
